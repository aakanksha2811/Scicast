Given that some questions will inevitably be wrong, there are two main options when betting on a question.


1. You bet based on the text of the question, along with a small chance that the question will be cancelled (and your bet will be reversed)


2. You bet based on the text of the question, along with a small chance that the question will be reinterpreted


The first scenario is simple: you bet based on what the question says. The second scenario is much more murky. In addition to judging the probability of the question, you must also judge the probabilities of various rewordings. This is generally much harder to do and less in what I perceive as the spirit of SciCast.

Can one get better leverage on this arbitrage (assuming a willingness to take on a certain amount of temporary directional exposure and that p(B) is more uncertain, say around 70%) by making a series of edits to p(A) and p(B)? If p(B|A) = 100% then the ratio of p(B | -A) and p(-A | B) is constrained to be [1 - p(A)] / p(B) = [1 - p(B) + [p(B) - p(A)]] / p(B) = [1 - p(B)] / p(B) + [p(B) - p(A)] / p(B).

Of course it's obviously wrong to think of it in this way for several reasons. (1) The gravity well of earth means it's wrong to think about the distribution of NEOs in our neighborhood as uniform, and (2) Orbital dynamics means it's wrong to use an inverse cube law (related to the volume of spherical neighborhoods of earth) because there are more bodies near the plane of the ecliptic.

I do not know the answer. Whatever this distribution is, you can try to fit its parameters to the NASA data. So now you get a marked point process with known parameters for NEO closest approach distances.

The <a href=""“http://www.oecd-nea.org/press/press-kits/economics.htm#5”"" rel=""nofollow"">original NEA resolution source</a> uses levelized cost of <b>energy</b> (LCOE), and cannot be used directly to resolve this question. (It also uses 2010 data!) But here is how it could have been used better.

NEA assumes Gen.III design, 60-year lifetime, and 85% load factor. For a 5% discounting rate, they estimate construction is ~60% of total cost. A new 1800MW plan would generate 804M MWh in its life. Using their LCOE of $61/MWh. gives a $48B break-even cost.   60% of that is $29B, divided by 1800MW is $16/W.  Even assuming financing was 3/4 of the construction costs, that would yield an overnight cost of $4/W.  

The question as stated would still resolve “No.”

Had it properly specified constant dollars, it <i>could </i> have resolved “Yes” because $4/W &lt; $4.30/W, but only if it were much more specific about cost calculations.

We will look into reimbursing forecasters.

If this is to be a meaningful forecasting exercise, I would really appreciate a clarification of the resolution criteria.

Mass is measured in kg, and 1/kg are the units of 1/mass and not of mass.

According to a study in Nature Climate Change, by Matthew England of the University of New South Wales and others, record trade winds have produced a sort of super-Niña. On average, sea levels have risen by about 3mm a year in the past 30 years. But those in the eastern Pacific have barely budged, whereas those near the Philippines have risen by 20cm since the late 1990s. A wall of warm water, in other words, is being held in place by powerful winds, with cool water rising behind it. According to Dr England, the effect of the trade winds explains most of the temperature pause.

The bigger issue is whether p(Nobel | not dark matter axions by 2015) should be essentially zero or somewhat higher, maybe 5%, to reflect the possibility of a Nobel for having SUCCESSFULLY detected axions which are NOT likely to explain dark matter.)",36:02.2,NULL,0,1,0,0

Responses to your questions:  (1) I think the gravitational mass being positive or negative is a confusing way to word this question.  I think it would be better to ask: will the gravitational interaction of antihydrogen to hydrogen be attractive or repulsive?  (2) Well, it seems the goal of the ALPHA project at CERN is to provide empirical evidence for antimatter in general.  Just like in regular matter, atoms such as hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, etc. don't have different gravitational properties. So it is implied that antihydrogen will behave the same as other antimatter atoms.  However I do agree that the question should be reworded to 'antihydrogen' since it is not certain that this will be the case.

1. First, only one of six units at the Boundary Dam Station is to be retrofitted with carbon capture. So, if the resolution is across the entire plant (not just the unit being retrofitted), carbon dioxide output will be much higher than the goal of 330 pounds per MW per hour.
/ 
2. Second, the news I've read doesn't anticipate this will be ready until 2015. Even if it's completed before 2015, and even if the resolution criterion is changed to just the unit being retrofitted, it looks like the project didn't begin until April 2014, so the average will include any carbon dioxide from the first three months of 2014.

The PNRA is demanding stringent modifications before allowing restart, after which the local authority and population will be asked to give the final approval. The Abe government has announced the replacement of two members of the PNRA with more industry-friendly experts, on expiry of their terms in September. Even if approval is given immediately after that, there won't be much time left in 2014 for much power generation. See below for a fairly recent summary.

The number 58% is ex-shell as a percent of in-shell. That number varies from year to year, but only by a couple of points. See p68. The federal ex-shell numbers (again p68) don't quite match your CA numbers, but they are close enough that I think they are ex-shell.

The <a href=""“http://www.oecd-nea.org/press/press-kits/economics.htm#5”"" rel=""nofollow"">original NEA resolution source</a> uses levelized cost of <b>energy</b> (LCOE), and cannot be used directly to resolve this question. (It also uses 2010 data!) But here is how it could have been used better.<br>

NEA assumes Gen.III design, 60-year lifetime, and 85% load factor. For a 5% discounting rate, they estimate construction is ~60% of total cost. A new 1800MW plan would generate 804M MWh in its life. Using their LCOE of $61/MWh. gives a $48B break-even cost.   60% of that is $29B, divided by 1800MW is $16/W.  Even assuming financing was 3/4 of the construction costs, that would yield an overnight cost of $4/W.  <br>

The question as stated would still resolve “No.”  Had it properly specified constant dollars, it <i>could </i> have resolved “Yes” because $4 &lt; $4.30, but only if it were much more specific about cost calculations. We will look into reimbursing forecasters.

Case of comparison: a homeless outreach center in Pensacola, Fla., is popular with the bitcoin community and has received about 420 BTC. They spent it on meals for the homeless as they received it, so probably got about $30K in value from these donations. But at current rates 420 BTC is worth over $250K.

In fact, I think this is the best reason for Paul to accept BTC. If his campaign were to buy BTC for speculative purposes, that would be regarded as reckless and irresponsible.

Net energy is published in peer reviewed journal since long.
maybe not all are in the TRWoS but many are like Naturwissenschaften or Journal of electroanalythical chemistry among the 153+ positive excess heat in P-R journals.

I would however be interested in finding (not negative, or theory) papers who find errors in all founding papers and experiments having some proven excess heat. Lewis striring theory and Hansen recombination are refuted by Wilson in his critic paper. Morrison paper is so incoherent and erroneous that many find hard to critic it. Wilson critic is good, and F&amp;P accepted some corrections, but he cannot contradict huge burst of heat observed, above chemistry.

Only recent critic, but refuted with mainstream arguments, is Kirk Shanahan CCS theory.

However the question, even as originally worded, seems problematic. Let us accept that ""enabled contactless payments"", by definition, means NFC-enabled POS terminal, and that the set of merchants which accept Apple Pay is identical to the set of merchants which have enabled contactless payments. (The validity of this assumption is a technical question: is it possible to selectively enable NFC payments on a standard NFC-capable POS terminal? I do not know.) The background confidently states that -- as of the time the question was written -- the number of such merchants is 220K. This seems to be based on Apple's September 9 press release stating that this number is ""more than 220K"". CVS and Rite Aid just disabled NFC payments at their 10K stores.

So # of qubits is like inverse of log p/p_th for a target logical error rate; much better to shrink p than add qubits, yes.

I've sent an email to Cooper, whose team found the current record holder, to ask his opinion (and if he replies I'll post it), but here's my reasoning to actually be very pessimistic, despite the source-less quote from Caldwell in the background. The expected ratio between p's for successive mersenne primes 2^p - 1 is about 1.48. You can work out from this that this question is exceedingly unlikely to resolve positively unless (optimistically) the 50th if not the 51st Mersenne prime is found by 2016. Moreover from (a) the essentially quadratic (in p) complexity of the Lucas-Lehmer test used to check primality, and (b) the prime number theorem, I estimate this will involve testing about 10 times more candidates, with difficulty (compared to the tests used to find M_48) per test increased by a factor ranging from 1 (for the first couple tests) to 10-20 (as you get higher up). ...(con't below)",44:54.2,NULL,0,0,0,0

It could also boost IT expenditures across the industry (it would be like a 5-10% price cut on a low end Dell a company might buy, I guess?).

Personally, I think teixobactin will make a great daptomycin/vancomycin substitute, kills MRSA really well, and there's a good chance it'll pass clinical trials. No real indication what side effects, but they have to be pretty bad for them to say no to a last resort antibiotic.

The seventh fattest state in 2013 was North Dakota at 67.6%. North Dakota would have to get 2.5 percentage points fatter in 2014 to be over 70%. That's not common. Just ten times since 2009 has a state gotten 2.5 percentage points fatter and only Tennessee did in 2013. Even if North Dakota goes over 70%, states like Oklahoma at 67.9% may not.

Thus I believe it's unlikely the question resolves over 6.

Now, there are a lot of smart people betting against me here, so there's a chance I'm doing something wrong. Many of your are better at statistics than me or you may know about short-term trends in American diets. Perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question in some silly way, and I'll admit there aren't large payoffs to moving the forecast very low.

But if I've done nothing wrong in my analysis, it's profitable to move the forecast towards 2.",42:40.8,NULL,0,1,0,0

How much of a consensus is required for this? If NASA says that they believe that they have found life and want to send more missions immediately, I am sure that congress would find experts who say that the reports of life are based on erroneous interpretations and they will trot out their own experts.

But two objections. 1) We know more than mean and variance: we know #samples, and even the samples themselves.  2) We don’t actually know the mean and variance at all. We estimate them based on few samples.<p>

The t distribution was designed for inference from small samples, but it may not be the right one to have used here. If we assume the true distribution is Gaussian with unknown mean, the t is the distribution of that mean for i.i.d. samples. That seems to be what we want, except these samples are not i.i.d.: they arise from different methods. So I think you’re right my suggestion to QM implicitly assumed the means of those methods were normally distributed around the true mean.</p>

Backing up, the problem for the future is to select the best method to use when we have conflicting estimates for the answer. Suggestions? (See also my answer to @Prieur above. And sorry for my late reply.)",29:30.2,6936,0,0,0,0

I think it's in my interest to disclose my rationale on this question since we will not have a resolution before the March 7 contest deadline. 


Bottom line: I suspect this question will resolve somewhere between 1 and 3.


Method 1:
The average state has grown .3% fatter each year since 2009. Adding .3% to each state's 2013  ""overweight and obese"" number yields just Arkansas over 70%. Mississippi is close at 69.6% and West Virginia is next at 69.1%.


Method 2:
Perhaps fat states are getting fatter faster than skinny states. To adjust for that, I took each state's individual trend since 2009 to predict it's 2014 result. Using that regression, I get Arkansas and Louisiana over 70%. Mississippi is close at 69.8%, and West Virginia is next at 68.7%. 


Method 3: 
Perhaps fat states are getting fatter very fast in the last year or two. Using one-year, two-year, and three-year trends, I get 2, 1, and 1 states over 70%, respectively. 


All three of these methods point to 1 or 2 fat states in 2014.",43:12.5,NULL,0,2,0,0
